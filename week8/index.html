      <h1>Interactive simulation</h1>
      <p>
        My idea was to make a rain that will help the "flower" to glow.<br />
        The rain follows the mouse.<br />
        As soon as it touches the circle ('flower') it starts frowing. When it's
        full-it becomes green. <br />
        When it's not raining, the flower becomes smaller.
      </p>

    <h1>Step 1</h1>
    <p>I started with the code of rain that I found online</p>

      >Rain code is here</a

    <h1>Step 2</h1>
    <p>
      Add a circle that represents a flower. I put it in the right down corner.
      what I kept in mind is the final diametr, cause it will grow.
    </p>

    <h1>Step 3</h1>
    <p>
      Now I want to make my rain to folow the mouse. In order to do that, I
      split up the screen into right and left sections (+gravity, to make it go
      faster).
    </p>
    <header class="header">
      <img src="images/move.png" />
    </header>

    <h1>Step 4</h1>
    <p>
      Now I want to change the radius of my circle. I set up the min and max
      numbers. As soon as the mouse in the right, the radius start growing. When
      it on the left side, it's going down.
    </p>
    <header class="header">
      <img src="images/circle2.png" />
    </header>

    <h1>Step 5</h1>
    <p>
      The last step is to change the color. To make it a gradient, I changed the
      first number in RGB by multiplying it to percentage of the circle's
      radius.
